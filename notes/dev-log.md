# Dev log

1. We created the react app called frontend with `npx create-react-app frontend` which is how you create a react app I guess.
2. The way react works is basically your index.html is as basic as possible and then you write react apps that render in the index.js file which then renders in the index.html via a DOM repaint
3. Then we cleaned up our stuff by deleting App.css and cleaning up App.js and deleting all the test file and css in index.css
